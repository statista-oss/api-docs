Once you have an API key, you can query the endpoints that you've been granted access to.

If you don't already have an API key, be sure to follow this guide:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Don't have an API key?" icon="key" href="request-api-key">
    Request an API key
  </Card>

</CardGroup>
You'll need to embed the API key in the a request header as shown below in a `curl` example:

```.sh
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.statista.ai/v1/<ENDPOINT> \
  --header 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>'
```
