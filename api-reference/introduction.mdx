## Overview

The Statista API allows secure access to data, enabling seamless integration into your applications and workflows.
Use this documentation to understand available endpoints, authentication, api packages and how to retrieve the data you need efficiently.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated including the x-api-key in a request header.

```json
"x-api-key": <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Integration
If you're integrating into LLM-based services or programatically building AI Agents, you may want to look at our MCP offering.

## API Rate Limits

The service is capable of supporting 10,000 requests per second. Ensure your application respects this limit to avoid throttling. If you need higher limits, please contact us.

## Caching
We cache requests; and the cache is flushed every 4 hours. We do not charge extra when retrieving cached requests.
