The Discovery Starter API is intended for users who want to search across Statista's vast
library of data - but do not need much information on each result.

The Discovery Starter API is limited to return the following data fields:

- ID
- Title
- Source(s)
- Teaser Image

Using this API allows you to limit search using limits, filters
and search terms.
