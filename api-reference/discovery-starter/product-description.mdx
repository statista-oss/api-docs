The Discovery Starter API is intended for users who want to search across Statista's vast
library of data - but do not need much information on each result.

The Discovery Starter API is limited to return the following data fields:

- ID
- Title
- Source(s)
- Teaser Image

Using this API allows you to limit search using limits, filters
and search terms.

#### Max. permitted value for `size` / `limit`

With the `Discovery Starter` package, you can retrieve up to 20 items per request.
By default, the response returns 10 items, but you may increase this number up to the maximum limit of 20. In case a value higher than 20 is specified, the response will still be limited to 20 items per request.
