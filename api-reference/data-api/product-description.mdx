The Data API is intended for users who want in-depth data and chart values for a specific
statistic. That ID can be found either with the Discovery API or directly on Statista's
website.

#### Endpoints

The `Data API` package allows access to the following endpoints:

- GET Statistic
- GET Report

The `Data API` package also includes endpoints similar to those in the `Discovery Advanced` package:

- GET Statistics
- GET Infographics
- GET Studies
- GET Market Insights
