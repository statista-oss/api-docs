The Discovery Advanced API is intended for users who want to search across Statista's
vast library of data - with full descriptions and additional content.

The Discovery Advanced API returns the following fields

- ID
- Title
- Source(s)
- Teaser Image
- Description
- Subject
- Geolocation(s)
- Industries
- Associated Files

Using this API allows you to limit search using limits, filters
and search terms.

#### Max. permitted value for `size` / `limit`

With the `Discovery Advanced` package, you can retrieve up to 10 items per request, which is also the default limit.
In case a value higher than 10 is specified, the response will still be limited to 10 items per request.
