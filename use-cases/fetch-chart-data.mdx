---

To use the Data API (`v1/data/statistic`), you need to identify the specific data you want to pull. 

This is in the format of an ID for e.g. a **statistic**. You can find these IDs by: a) Using the Discovery API, b) using the Statista website - you'll find the ID in the URL when viewing a specific statistic. 

Say that you wish to pull the raw data for [Nike's Revenue](https://www.statista.com/statistics/241683/nikes-sales-worldwide-since-2004/), you'd identify the ID of this statistic from the URL to be: **241683**. 

You'd then append that ID as a query parameter like so: `v1/data/statistic?id=241683`

Here's an example of pulling data for a specific ID:

```python
STAT_ID="241683"
base_url = f"https://api.statista.ai/v1/data/statistic?id={STAT_ID}"

headers = {"x-api-key": f"{os.getenv('DATA_API_KEY')}"}

response = requests.get(base_url, headers=headers)
data = json.loads(response.text)
```

Which would yield the following JSON: 

```json
