title: Intranets and Federated Search
description: "Using Statista's Discovery Advanced API to search for content"
---

<Info>
  Statista does not allow for crawling systematically across our data. If you
  attempt to do so; we will disable your API key.
</Info>

In the case where you want to show Statista content to your users based on a search query
in a federated search system or intranet; this guide is for you.

This guide will use the **Discovery Advanced API** and requires an **<a href='/start/request-api-key'>API Key</a>**.

Using Python, you'll learn how to:

1. Configure variables needed for HTTP client
2. Execute an API query
3. Render information returned back by the Statista API

### 1. Configure variables needed for HTTP client

You'll connect to the API using a request header: `x-api-key`. In order to fetch
content, you'll need to decide which endpoint you want to request from;
`/statistics`, `/marketInsights`, `/studies` or `/infographics`. See <a
href="/api-reference/introduction">API Reference</a>.{" "}

For this example we'll fetch content from `/statistics` with
two parameters.

```python
import requests
import json
import pprint

base_url = "https://api.statista.ai/v1/statistics" # Alternate between endpoints as needed
headers = {"x-api-key": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"}
params = {"q": "basketball", "limit": "5"} # Using the URL parameters available on the API. See API Reference.
```

This is the basic setup you'll need to get this example running on your machine - we
don't recommend using this code in production.

### 2. Execute an API query

Next, we can execute a request and get a response from the API.

```python
response = requests.get(base_url, headers=headers, params=params) # Fetch data

print(response.status_code) # Check if request was successful

data = json.loads(response.text) # Load raw data as JSON
pprint.pp(data)

```

### 3. Render information returned back by the Statista API

While you can do this in a multitude of ways; we'll show an example for putting the
received data into a pandas data frame - and show you what that looks like:

```python
import pandas as pd


df = pd.json_normalize(data['items'])
pprint.pp(df)
```

Which yields a structured table:
