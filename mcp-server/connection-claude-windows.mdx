## What you'll need
- Your Statista API Key 
- Claude Desktop installed on your PC 
- Node.js installed (we'll help you install this) 

## Step-by-step instructions
### Step 1: Install NodeJS
1. Open your web browser 
2. Go to: https://nodejs.org/ 
3. Click the big green button that says "LTS" (Recommended for Most Users) 
4. Find the downloaded file in your Downloads folder and double-click it 
5. Click "Next" on everything until it finishes installing 
6. Restart your computer 

### Step 2: Get Your Statista API Key 
- Keep this somewhere safe - you'll need it in a moment! 

### Step 3: Open Claude's Configuration Folder 
- Press `Windows Key + R` on your keyboard (this opens the "Run" box) 
- Type exactly: `%APPDATA%\Claude`
- Press `Enter` - a folder will open 

### Step 4: Create or Edit the Configuration File 
Look for a file called `claude_desktop_config.json`

##### If the file EXISTS:
Right-click it → Open with → Notepad 

##### If the file DOESN'T exist: 
- Right-click in the empty space → New → Text Document 
- Name it: claude_desktop_config.json 
- Open it with Notepad 

### Step 5: Add Your Configuration 
**Delete everything** in the file (if there's anything there), then paste this: 

```json
{ 
  "mcpServers": { 
    "statista": { 
      "command": "C:\\PROGRA~1\\nodejs\\npx.cmd", 
      "args": [ 
        "-y", 
        "mcp-remote", 
        "https://api.statista.ai/v1/mcp", 
        "--transport", 
        "http-only", 
        "--header", 
        "x-api-key: ${API_KEY}" 
      ], 
      "env": { 
        "API_KEY": "INSERT KEY HERE" 
      } 
    } 
  } 
} 
```

### Step 6: Add Your API Key 
Find this line near the bottom: 
  "API_KEY": "INSERT KEY HERE" 

Replace `INSERT KEY HERE` with your actual Statista API key from Step 2. 

For example, if your key is sk_1234abcd5678efgh, it should look like: 
```json
  "API_KEY": "sk_1234abcd5678efgh" 
```
<Info>
  Important: Keep the quotes ("") around your key 
</Info>

### Step 7: Save the file
- In Notepad, click File → Save as .js 
- Close Notepad 

### Step 8: Restart Claude Desktop
- Completely close Claude Desktop (hard exit under “Files”) 
- Open Claude Desktop again 

### Step 9: Test it! 
Look for the Statista icon or tools indicator in Claude - this means it's connected!

<Info>
Make sure Statista is toggled on, and then ask a Statista related question!  
If it works, Claude will fetch live data from Statista for you!

### Troubleshooting 
##### If you get an error about Node.js 
- Make sure you installed Node.js from **Step 1**
- Make sure you restarted your computer after installing Node.js 
- Try opening Claude again 

##### If nothing happens
- Make sure you completely closed and reopened Claude 
- Check that your API key is correct (no extra spaces) 
- Make sure the quotes are in the right places 

##### If you see "invalid JSON"
- Check that you have all the curly braces `{` and `}`
- Check that every line except the last one in each section has a comma `,`
- Try copying the code again from this document
