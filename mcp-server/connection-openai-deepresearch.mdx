<Info>
  This guide shows you how to set up the Statista MCP server with the OpenAI DeepResearch API using the ```openai``` python SDK.
</Info>

In order to connect the Statista MCP server to DeepResearch functionality, you'll need to append the provided MCP Server URL from Statista with `/beta/deepresearch`. 

You should see the tools ```search``` and ```fetch``` available. 

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY)
mcp_server_url = f"{PROVIDED_STATISTA_MCP_URL}/beta/deepresearch"

response = client.responses.create(
    model="o4-mini-deep-research", # Any OpenAI DeepResearch model can be used
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "mcp",
            "server_label": "statista_mcp",
            "server_url": mcp_server_url,
            "require_approval": "never",
            "headers": {
                "x-api-key": YOUR_STATISTA_API_KEY
            }
        },
    ],
    input=query,
)

print(response.text)
```
